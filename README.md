# 警eto

Why 警eto ? Because https://translate.google.com/?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&client=tw-ob#eo/en/%C4%B5eto


*This is currently a work in progress* 

警eto is the web interface to several APIs (nginx-api, vagrant-worker and htpasswd-api).

With 警eto you add and manage (start/stop/provision) vagrant projects on the fly without connecting via SSH.

###Providers
Providers like **vagrant-vsphere**, allowing you to deploy your vagrant project into a VMWare cluster;  **pluginvagrant-aws** which deploys your project right onto Amazon AWS or any other can all be used

###ACL

Access Control Management has been implemented. You can restrict access to project (a group of vagrant instances). You can also give access on the host level.

As an example : You will be able to give a group of Developers access to a project. But only the lead developer has PROD access.  

So all developers can deploy/start/stop/provision the DEV environment but only the lead has access to deploy to the PROD environment

###GIT
Git and multi-machines are now supported. You can launch a vagrant instance from a project that is linked 
from a git repository. At creation time you can choose which branch/tag you want to use.

Feel free to contact us if you want a little demo around the project.
